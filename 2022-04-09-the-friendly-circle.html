        A friendly circle, alone in the dark,
        reaching out to connect with smaller circles around it.
        Some are farther away, and try to pull it in,
        and some periodically connect just like clockwork.
        Others closer to it, comfortably meet in the middle,
        but drift farther until they can't connect any more.
        And the circle finds itself, trying to connect with other circles,
        who are just as stubbornly small and as farther.
        All of this stretching wanes the circle, reaching so far for so long,
        it starts to lose the hope it once had.
        It becomes less of a leader and more of a pleaser,
        so no wrongs could be caused from it's actions.
        And at some points, the circle's too tired for more,
        it instinctively shrinks and relaxes.
        But it still isn't happy, and it questions itself,
        if it connected with right circles after all.
        So who knows what will happen, to the trying little circle,
        who just wanted a circle like them to bond.
