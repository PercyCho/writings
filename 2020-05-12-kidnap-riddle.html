    <p>A man’s wife is kidnapped, and the kidnapper leaves a note. In the note, the kidnapper explains that his wife is in an abandoned house, and the kidnapper has hooked up a bomb to a smartphone that will blow up when it’s clock strikes 2 AM. The kidnapper demands $10,000 and says the man should arrive at most 5 minutes before the bomb explodes to make the deal and receive his wife. The kidnapper also notes that the man better not play any tricks or try to take his wife back by force, or else the kidnapper will do something awful. The husband, however, has served in the military. So, refusing to pay the kidnapper, he grabs all the weapons he needs and leaves. Instead of arriving 5 or 10 minutes prior, the husband arrives 30 minutes prior to the explosion time, only to find that the house has already blown up and in shambles. A police report the next day says that not only his wife, but the kidnapper too blew up in the explosion.</p>

    <p>The kidnapper didn’t commit suicide. It was simply daylight savings time. The bomb blew up when the clock turned 2 AM, so at 12 AM that day, everyone in the problem thought they had 2 hours before the bomb blew up, when they actually only had 1.</p>
