        Lovely, online friend of mine<br>
        Of personal, virtual disguise<br>
        At times, a question escapes my guise<br>
        "What rests behind those tired eyes?"<br>
        Such peculiar habits you present here<br>
        While most a collection of your past peers<br>
        Often conscious hesitation is very clear<br>
        What experience caused this social fear?<br>
        Well recognised, but not well connected<br>
        These are just the friendships youâ€™ve invented<br>
        Why audibly ponder on a life you've pretended<br>
        What others could you have truly affected?<br>
        How do you pierce the bubble you've laid yourself in,<br>
        When stark organisation is "creativity's sin"<br>
        And abhorrent authority makes it difficult to pin<br>
        If this is your cycle, then how do you win?<br>
        Issues of us humans come and go<br>
        Some stick around for longer, though<br>
        Albeit, our mortality eventually goes<br>
        Still fear what others often joke?<br>
        More insipid days, of missing the dawn<br>
        Clinging to what's not worth more than a yawn<br>
        Certain hope has misplaced itself somewhere far gone<br>
        What really pushes to brazen on?<br>
        A courteous laugh to the question's thought<br>
        You just reiterate your stories of nought<br>
        You'd be in my arms if not for the distance<br>
        How do you prove your reason for existence?
