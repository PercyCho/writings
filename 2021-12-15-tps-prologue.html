    Waiting<br>Thinking<br>In mutual silence.<br><br><br>

















Taking in the ever-changing view ahead of them, so much so that the slight wind chill turned to white noise on their ears and skin.<br>Sharing an unspoken melancholic feeling.<br><br><br>

















Purposely lost in thought, one gathered a few chosen words to reflect the scene ahead, patient for the right time.<br><br><br>

















“Do you remember when tall, bright clouds, fell across a radiant blue sky, before these dark airships, rode through such an ultraviolet one?”<br>A pause.<br>“Funny, I don’t.”<br><br><br>

♩ Goodbye Blue Sky Starts<br><br><br>

















The autumn grass moved with the wind around their feet. Behind them, the few trees rooted there had all maintained their summer green hue, despite their location on the large hill. Below them, the ground dropped off at a naturally steep angle, flattening out a few 50 meters below, before widening out into the view of the distance-faded town below them.<br>The longer the two looked, the more that appeared to them. Not many take such time for appreciation, so after letting the moment sink in enough to fill their body and  mind, they thanked it, taking their time, but reluctant to leave.<br><br><br>

But before this perfect future, a few hundred years back, a similarly cold, Ouran blue sky, faded in value, cycling nightly lights to turn on to light the darkness. One tall, orange saturated light, on a quiet, suburban street, shone directly through the window of a second story room, casting onto its opposite wall. Also in thought, or in awe, the boy of that room, solo in his consciousness, was resting still on the wall, blinding himself with the dim light. Unsure whether to be excited, depressed, or worried, he continued to reminisce that day.<br><br><br>

















In hindsight, he should have been very scared. Tomorrow would be the first day of the rest of his life.<br><br><br>
