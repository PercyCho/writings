    <p>The longer I thought, the more I was getting annoyed at the algebra problem in my homework. But it was the last one anyway, so i got up to refresh my mind and come back to it later. The night was still pretty young, and I only had a science worksheet left to do.</p>
    <p>I logged back into my computer to check my friends server and noticed there weren’t many people online, not even any mods, which was a little surprising. The only channel that had activity was the main one, so I checked it out.</p>
    <p>To my surprise, over 50 messages had been sent between my friend and his girlfriend, which at first glance, seemed to be an argument. This gave me a shock, and I scrolled up to the top of the conversation to catch up.</p>
    <br>
    <blockquote>
        <strong>Friend</strong>: im gonna play some [competitive game] if anyone wants to join<br>
        <strong>Girlfriend</strong>: I thought you didn’t like that game?<br>
        <strong>Friend</strong>: it can be really glitchy so i don’t like playing it much<br>
        <strong>Girlfriend</strong>: You’re just going to get mad after.<br>
        I don’t like it when you’re mad.<br>
        <strong>Friend</strong>: i just feel like playing it right now<br>
        if the first few games are bullshit ill get off<br>
        <strong>Girlfriend</strong>: So just don’t play it.<br>
        <strong>Friend</strong>: Don’t tell me what to do?<br>
        <strong>Girlfriend</strong>: I don’t want you to be mad for no reason<br>
        I’m just looking out for you.<br>
        <strong>Friend</strong>: And sometimes I want to play a game even if it makes me mad<br>
        I don’t like that you feel like you know what’s best for me<br>
        <strong>Girlfriend</strong>: I hate it when you’re mad, I can’t talk to you<br>
        I don’t know what’s best for you, I just want to help you.<br>
        <strong>Friend</strong>: well you’re not helping lol<br>
        You never approve of anything I like anyway. There’s always a problem with it<br>
        <strong>Girlfriend</strong>: What the hell? I can’t help you as your girlfriend?<br>
        Games aren’t my thing. I’ve played them with you and they’re just not for me.<br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>As I kept scrolling, the argument continued, with more and more disapproving statements and claims towards each other. It hurt to read. But they were still typing with each other as I caught up with all the messages.</p>
    <br>
    <blockquote>
        <strong>Friend</strong>: I’m just NEVER ENOUGH for you AM I?<br>
        Why are you even dating someone like me if you don’t like what I do?<br>
        <strong>Girlfriend</strong>: OH MY GOD THATS NTO TRUE<br>
        ARE YOU JUST GOING TO FORGET ALL THE TIMES I WAS THERE FOR YOU?<br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I decided to interject.</p>
    <br>
    <blockquote>
        <strong>Horol</strong>: I’m not a mod or anything, but I suggest you guys move this to dms<br>
        or speak in vc about it<br>
        <strong>Friend</strong>: ok<br>
        I'll be in vc<br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I saw them both join the main voice channel.</p>
    <p>As much as I was disheartened by their argument, I was equally concerned for them, and after pondering for a few moments, I decided to join the vc too.</p>
    <p><em>Dun, da da dun!</em></p>
    <p>“-you’re SO SELFISH!”</p>
    <p>“Says YOU!”</p>
    <p>It was heartbreaking to listen to, but I had to help my friend if anything went wrong.</p>
    <p>“OK OK listen,” my friend started, “I just hate that you have a problem with everything I do, and treat me like I’m- annoying!”</p>
    <p>“I DON’T treat you like you’re annoying, I JUST want to help you from getting this way!” The girlfriend responded with an audible wavering in her voice, “I love you, so just please-”</p>
    <p>“NO, you DON’T!” my friend interrupted.</p>
    <p>“YES I DO!” she cried.</p>
    <p>“No, [girlfriend], you don’t love me. You love your idea of me.”</p>
    <p>There was a moment of silence where what he said was processed.</p>
    <p>A small sniff could be heard from the girlfriend’s silent crying, until she replied.</p>
    <p>“Fuck you.”</p>
    <p><em>Da da dun</em></p>
    <p>The two of us stayed silent in the call for a little while longer. I wanted to say something to him, but I couldn’t think of anything. All I had done was offer for them to speak directly, which is all they had needed.</p>
    <p>“Goddammit” he said, with a shakiness in his voice.</p>
    <p><em>Da da dun</em></p>
    <p>It looked like he didn’t want to say anything to me either, so I too left.</p>
    <p>I could see one of the mods was now online, and went to the main channel to see what he would say. Like for me, it took a minute for him to read what had been said, but he then replied.</p>
    <br>
    <blockquote>
        <strong>Mod</strong>: Im so sorry you two, I hope you work this out :(
    </blockquote>
    <p>I wasn’t as sure, considering how they had sounded in the call, but there was still hope. They had been together in the server for a while and always seemed happy with each other, because of how much I had heard they were supportive of each other in the last couple months.</p>
    <p>I needed to give my mind a break before I went back to homework.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>In the next couple days, neither of them were active at all, which concerned me. But before I was going to message my friend about it, I saw the notification that his girlfriend had left the server. I assumed that things had only gone south.</p>
