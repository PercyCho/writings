    <p>Septance is a well-known technology company that has accomplished many achievements since its founding in the mid-70’s. But what are these achievements, and how did they accomplish them? Throughout the history of Septance, it’s been shown they can continue to define the future of technology of the time, and this essay will explain how they do so.</p><p>Septance was originally called “Cornerstore Computing Technology” (CCT) started by James Septance in 1975 as a small computer/typewriter business in their town that produced computer parts and tried to develop new ones. James was originally an archeologist, but after collapsing a structure on an exploration, he was sent out of the company, which is where he went back to his hometown to start a business around the interest of his, computing technology. After four years of building their company and making simple products, CCT finished and released their first big product, a new CPU. To the world, it was ahead of its time, and unlike anything anyone had ever seen. One newspaper report stated, “In the eyes of technology enthusiasts… it was revolutionary” The product spread to the big technology companies of the time, who paid them lots of money to reproduce their product, helping James grow his business. By 1981, CCT had upgraded their storefront, which ended up being four times the size it originally occupied, and developed a faster and more compact memory storage system. Some business experts of the time claimed CCT, “will continue to grow, for as long as James Septance can tell the future.”</p><p>By 1983, CCT had bought a whole city block, and work started on their new headquarters. But they weren’t alone in their growth, because around that time, another computing company had also been growing, but at a more steady rate. Scerta Relynquo was another man who started a technology company in the 70’s, and recently, changed the name of his company to “Relynquo”. James followed suit and renamed his company to “Septance”, which was the rough beginning of their 8 year long feud. Anything Septance seemed to do, Relynquo seemed to do better, and vice versa. Slowly, people started to recognize it as time went on, and commented on it by saying, “I haven’t seen corporate competition of this size before… it makes it hard to choose a side.” As the battle of the two tech companies went on, they both got bigger and bigger. James liked this kind of attention for his company, because he knew it was just for show, but he had never once talked to Relynquo and his company about it, which made him uneasy if they were playing this competition for show like he was, or taking it very seriously. The new Septance Headquarters was completed in 1986, and despite James’s doubts, they continued their selling battle for four more years until something unusual was noticed in the summer of 1990. A worker from Septance saw some workers from Relynquo taking resources which didn’t seem like theirs. The Septance workers reported it to the Septance higher-ups, which was filed to the police, and after they looked into it, they came back reporting that the situation was much bigger than they had originally imagined. The next sixteen months was followed with a legal battle, uncovering the many misdeeds Relynquo had partaken in behind the public’s backs. The press made the situation very well known to the public, which protested buying Relynquo products, sending the company farther down in their debt, eventually bankrupting them by the end of 1991. James couldn’t help but feel sorry even though he’d done the right thing, and after everything settled, people complimented Septance for “winning” the corporate battle, “Septance has truly shown their dedication to innovation and trustworthiness through this legal dispute, which makes me proud to continue supporting them for whatever comes next.”</p><p>The aftermath of the battle made Septance even more well known, raising their status to one of the top tech giants in the world. For the next few years after, people noticed Septance products didn’t really improve, because they didn’t have any more competition they had to face. One reviewer wrote about this issue, explaining, “I respect Septance… but they’ve either become lazy without Relynquo, or they’re planning on releasing something big.” Much to people’s surprise, they didn’t end up releasing something big, because in the summer of 1996, James Septance caught a very deadly disease, and passed away a few weeks later. But the company was not lost, because James’s son, Reino Septance, inherited the company shortly after, and did not wait to pick production back up again. In the next few years, Septance started making newer and better computer parts, just like before. Reino, still sad over the loss of his father, decided to dedicate James in the form of Septance’s first operating system, JamesOS. Newspaper reporters described JamesOS as, “A breath of fresh air… it’s fast, it’s sleek, and it’s amazing for Septance to dedicate their first OS to their first CEO, James.” Since then, Septance has kept striving to push forward into the future, now starting to make transportation robots as their next big thing.</p><p>Since its creation, Septance has persevered to keep re-inventing the future of technology, through whatever hardships or challenges they’ve faced. Whether it be releasing a CPU even as a small company, or through a corporate battle, or a whole operating system in dedication to the giants that came before.</p>
