        A happy world
        A joking world
        A world of his’try past.
        When tourists came, the culture shock
        made their world seem savagely rash.
        Instinctually, tourists voiced complaints
        from their ideals built on class.
        “Why foster hatred without reason?”
        Folk answered to questions asked.
        At first tourists couldn’t understand
        how such moderness could lead
        with no respect for the differently fortunate -
        They were tempted to leave.
        But some gave this world another go
        and folk welcomed them all the same.
        Tourists took their advice and explored around
        to get their reference framed.
        And then they started to notice that people
        were different, yet somehow the same.
        They all understood to a scary level
        so no misunderstood hate was made.
        Police stations were barren.
        And far less of the city signs
        that told people what was common sense.
        Some doubted - dug deeper
        but only to find
        there was no strict ruler in sight.
        No underlying scheme,
        No threat behind the scenes.
        They just did all this because it was right.
        When the fraction of tourist
        came to this realization
        they ran and they bargained to stay.
        They didn't realize at first
        this utopia of a civilization
        so they wanted to fit in the same way.
        But when the folk saw these tourists
        with money in their hands
        and desperate looks in their eyes
        they knew better, and had no choice but to say:
        “Sorry, you’re just not ready for us yet.”
        And kicked them out without anymore they could say.
        And none of those tourists learned.
